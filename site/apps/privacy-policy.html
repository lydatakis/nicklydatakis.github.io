  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October&nbsp;2025</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October&nbsp;2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>CodeMentor&nbsp;Quiz</strong> (the “App”), also distributed on Google Play as <strong>Programming Quiz Guide</strong>.
    This document explains how the App handles information and describes the limited data that may be collected automatically by integrated third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share personally identifiable information.  
    However, certain non-personal data may be collected automatically by third-party services such as:
  </p>

  <h3>a. Google&nbsp;AdMob</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses Google AdMob to display banner and interstitial advertisements.  
    AdMob may automatically collect information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising&nbsp;ID)</li>
    <li>Approximate location, IP address, and device information</li>
    <li>App usage data and interactions with ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is processed according to
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> and
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob’s Data Processing Policies</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Google Play Services</h3>
  <p>
    Google Play Services may collect anonymous diagnostics and analytics (e.g., crash reports, performance data) to improve the App’s stability.
    This data is handled under
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
    <li>Improving performance and stability</li>
    <li>App analytics and diagnostics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The App developer does not sell, trade, or share data with external parties beyond what is required by third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Consent for Users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland</h2>
  <p>
    For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, the App uses a
    <strong>Google-certified Consent Management Platform (CMP)</strong> compliant with the
    <strong>IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)</strong>.
    A consent form is shown to allow users to choose whether they agree to personalized advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users may update or withdraw their consent at any time using device settings or the consent dialog if available.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for general audiences but is not directed toward children under 13 years of age.
    If you are under 13, use of the App should be supervised by a parent or guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not directly store personal data.  
    Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that any information handled by third-party services remains protected.  
    However, because these services are provided by independent companies, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does not store user data on its servers.  
    Any data collected by Google AdMob or Google Play Services is retained and processed according to their own policies.  
    Users may request deletion of advertising data by resetting their Advertising&nbsp;ID or adjusting their privacy settings in Google Settings.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising through your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset or delete your Advertising&nbsp;ID</li>
    <li>Disable “Ad Personalization” in Google Settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    More information is available at
    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.  
    Continued use of the App after any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
