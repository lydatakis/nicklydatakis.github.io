  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>CodeMentor&nbsp;Quiz</strong> (the “App”).  
    This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information and explains the limited data that may be collected automatically by third-party services integrated within the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share personally identifiable information.  
    However, certain non-personal data may be collected automatically by third-party services:
  </p>

  <h3>a. Google&nbsp;AdMob</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.  
    AdMob may collect information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising&nbsp;ID)</li>
    <li>Approximate location, IP address, and device information</li>
    <li>Interaction data with ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is processed according to
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Google Play Services</h3>
  <p>
    Google Play Services may automatically collect anonymous diagnostics and analytics
    (such as crash reports) to improve performance.

    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    Any information collected through these services is used solely for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
    <li>App performance monitoring</li>
    <li>Improving the user experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The App developer does not sell, trade, or otherwise share data with external parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for general audiences but is not directed toward children under 13 years of age.
    If you are under 13, please use the App under the supervision of a parent or guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not directly store user data.  
    Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that any information handled by integrated third-party services remains protected.  
    Because these services are provided by independent companies, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset or delete your Advertising ID</li>
    <li>Disable “Ad Personalization” in Google Settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    More information is available at
    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
    Any changes will be posted here with a new effective date.  
    Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
