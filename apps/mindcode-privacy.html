  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December&nbsp;2025</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December&nbsp;2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>MindCode: Number Puzzle</strong> (the “App”), developed and published by the App Developer.
    It explains how the App handles information and describes limited data that may be collected automatically by third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share personally identifiable information.
    However, certain non-personal data may be collected automatically by integrated third-party services:
  </p>

  <h3>a. Google AdMob</h3>
  <p>
    The App displays banner and interstitial ads using Google AdMob.
    AdMob may automatically collect information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Approximate location and device information</li>
    <li>IP address and app-usage statistics</li>
    <li>Interactions with advertisements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These details are processed in accordance with
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> and
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob’s Data Processing Policies</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Google Play Services</h3>
  <p>
    Google Play Services may collect anonymous analytics (e.g., crash reports or performance data) to help improve the App’s stability.
    This information is governed by
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
    <li>Improving app performance and stability</li>
    <li>Anonymous analytics and diagnostics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The developer does not sell, trade, or share any data beyond what is required by third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Consent for Users in the EEA, UK and Switzerland</h2>
  <p>
    For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland,
    the App uses a <strong>Google-certified Consent Management Platform (CMP)</strong> compliant with the
    <strong>IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)</strong>.
    A consent form appears to allow users to choose whether they agree to personalized ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can update or withdraw consent at any time using device privacy settings or the consent dialog (if available).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for general audiences but not directed toward children under 13 years of age.
    If you are under 13, please use the App only with the supervision of a parent or guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not store any personal data on its own servers.
    Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that information processed by third-party services remains protected.
    Because those services are operated independently, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not retain user data.
    Any information collected by Google AdMob or Google Play Services is retained and processed under their own policies.
    Users may delete advertising data by resetting their device’s Advertising ID or adjusting Google Settings.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset or delete your Advertising ID</li>
    <li>Disable “Ad Personalization” in Google Settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
    Continued use of the App after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
